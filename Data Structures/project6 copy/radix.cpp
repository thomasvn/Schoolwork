 * Description:	Read a sequence of non-negative integers from the
 *		standard input and sort then using radix sort.  Each
 *		integer in the list is dropped into a bucket by its least
 *		significant digit.  After all integers are placed in
 *		buckets, the buckets are copied back into the list and we
 *		repeat the process, but with the next most significant
 *		digit.  After all digits have been processed, the list is
 *		sorted!  Since the buckets need to preserve the order of
 *		insertion, we need to implement a queue.  A deque provides
 *		this functionality for us.  The algorithm can be found at
 *		wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort.

# Write a Perl program that uses a hash and a large number of operations on
# the hash. For example, the hash could store peopleâ€™s names and their ages.
# A random-number generator could be used to create three-character names and
# ages, which could be added to the hash. When a duplicate name was generated,
# it would cause an access to the hash but not add a new element. Rewrite the
# same program without using hashes. Compare the execution efficiency of the
# two. Compare the ease of programming and readability of the two.
